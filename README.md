# Weather

Used SwifUI most of the project but to show an example of mixing UIKIT and SwiftUI I have created a navigation viewcontroller of UIKIT.

# Architecture
Followed MVVM architecture:


ViewModel - Fetches data from Repository and updates the state objects which eventually updates the UI. 
Repository - Responsible to fetch data from server and store data into database if offline support is required ViewController - Controls refreshing and actions of view.

No External (3rd party) libraries are used to build this project

# Improvements
Created separate swift package for screens/flows, utils, core things that can be resued in another places.
Add Hourly data to the Weather details screen
Add Reactive Database either Coredata/Realm instead of UserDefaults used to store City inform

Create Flow Coordinators to separate flows and navigation stack
Add Analytics/logger whereever required
Build a cache layer for any resources
